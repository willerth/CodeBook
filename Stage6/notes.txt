The book doesn't tell us what kind of cipher was used to encrypt this message.
However, Chapter 3 talked about 3 new kinds of ciphers, each of which boils down
to a monoalphabetic cipher with a very long key, possibly longer than the plaintext
message itself. The first cipher uses a long, albeit coherent, key, such as a
passage of text from a book or a list of related items. The second cipher (the
one-time pad, which is theoretically impossible to break) uses a randomly-generated
nonsensical key. The third cipher is the one generated by the enigma machine.
The first two are vigenere ciphers - the third is not. I assume that stages 6-8 will
use these three ciphers.

My initial approach will be based on the assumption that the plaintext is in english, and
that the word "the" appears fairly often throughout the message.

TODO: Create a python function that generates three-letter snippets of a potential key by
iterating through each character in the ciphertext and assuming that the character, along with
the two following characters, encodes the word "the." This function can be extended to search
for other common letters. Each three-letter snippet will be manually evaluated by me, and the
ones that look promising can be used to attempt to determine what the key is.
