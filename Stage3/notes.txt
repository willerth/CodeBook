Stage 3 is a homophonic cipher, as described on page 52 of Singh's book

Wrote util.py to create a set of tables and write them to the file util.txt
These tables document the frequency of each combination of characters that
appears in the cipher.

The book explicitly made mention of the behavior of the letter "q" in the english
language. "q" is only ever followed by "u", and both of these letters occur rarely
within most english passages. so, if I can find these two letters, I may be able to 

A is followed by V, C, and i, all of which are pretty common
H is followed by MGFZ, which (with the exception of F) are fairly uncommon, with M and G being very rare
O is followed by QF, which are again common
R is only followed by P - this is our most likely candidate for the sequence 'qu'



Interesting things about this cipher:
The frequencies of characters vary considerably. I'd expect to see more common letters mapping to
multiple letters in the cipher alphabet, resulting in a more even distribution of characters in the
cyphertext.

I'm also intrigued by the fact that there are only 27 characters appearing in the cyphertext
(28 if \n is included. As of the time of writing this, util.py does not track newlines. The lines in
encrypted.txt are not of uniform length, but the ciphertext in the book is formatted in such a way that
lines ARE of uniform length. Therefore, it's unclear to me whether to look at newlines). I'd expect most
english letters to be present in the plaintext, and many english letters in the plain alphabet should be
mapped to at least two letters in the cipher alphabet.

Lastly, the existence of so many repeated letters is interesting. Again, many letters in the plain alphabet
should be mapped to multiple letters in the cipher alphabet, so most (if not all) instances of double letters
in the plaintext should be mapped to a string of two distinct letters in the cipher.
