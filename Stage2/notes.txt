FABER EST SUAE QUISQUE FORTUNAE APPIUS CLAUDIUS CAECUS

DICTUM ARCANUM EST NEUTRON




It was known that this was a Caesar cypher, so I just brute-forced it by essentially
creating 25 possible cypher alphabets and deciphering the message according to each
alphabet. The only message that looked like anything other than gibberish, which was
the result of shifting the alphabet 19 places to the right, or 7 to the left(so that
H, the eighth letter of the alphabet, gets mapped to A, the first)
